### Hello, I'm Ben Weston 👋
I'm a CS student at University of Liverpool. You'll probably know me best for my [super pretty notes](https://notes.bweston.uk) 😉.

If you feel one of my projects have helped you out please: 

* Give them a star.  🌟
* Consider sharing any any improvements you'd like to see as an issue ❗ or pull request on the project. 

If you still want to give more, then my paypal is here: https://www.paypal.me/bweston6. Don't feel you have to give anything if you use a projects, we're all students after all.
